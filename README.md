# Project 5 The Solar System

In this project we have created a simulation of the Solar System. This is done by the use of both forward Euler algorithm and the velocity Verlet algorithm. The main program is coded in C++ and the code file is named solar_system.cpp in this depository. Classes are used to object orient our code for adding other planets to the system in a efficient way. Note that various runs are slashed out in the .cpp file within the main function. One should run one part at a time and they are seperated as part a, b, c and d. The results of each of these parts is then plotted using Python. The plots are generated from the orbit_plots.py file and marked as task a, b, c or d.

The cpp script solar_system.cpp performs the various integrations

Data analysis is done with the python script orbit_plot.py. This script uses the files generated by solar_system.cpp


We have not commited the data files to the repository as some of the files may be too large to commit. The data files are easily created when the .cpp files are run and the various slashed out parts is included.
